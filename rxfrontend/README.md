This is the front-end of the RxView application, built in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

This is likely running inside of a Docker container, as explained in the parent README. However, this can also be run individually, with the following instruction.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# NOTE:
The backend server, in NestJS, must be running at http://localhost:3001 in order for the site to be functional.
